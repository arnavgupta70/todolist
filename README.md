Hi! In this file, I will be explaining the usage for my Project - "ToDoList". 

# Disclaimer: This project is still a work in progress. 

"ToDoList" is currently a website based tracker which allows the user to create tasks which they need to complete and the specific date they plan on completing the task. After fully completing the project, I plan in converting this project into an application.

When you run the application using "flask run", the Homepage loads. If you are a first-time user, you will have to register for an account first.
The username and password can be anything of your choices however, the password must be atleast 8 characters with a letter and a number.

Once you login, in the Header, you will see 3 options: "Create New Task", "Update Tasks" and "Completed Tasks". On the Homescreen, you will find
instructions and a table which will be used to display your tasks. When you want to add a task, click "Create New Task" which will redirect
you to a different screen. On this screen, you will be asked to enter the "Task Name" and the "Completion Date". The "Add Item" will be hidden until
you enter a Task Name. Once you click "Add Item", you will be redirected to the Homepage and you will see the new task in the table. There will
also be a flash at the top of the screen informing you that the task has been added. You can add as many tasks as you like.

When you complete a task, click on "Update Tasks" in the Header. This will redirect you to another screen. Here, you will see a Drop Down menu
with all your task names and the day you started them. Select the Task you have completed and then proceed to click "Mark As Complete". Once you click
"Mark As Complete", you will be redirected to the Homepage and you will see that the task has been removed from the table. There will also be a flash
at the top of the screen congratulating you completing the task.

If you want to see all the tasks you have completed, click on "Completed Tasks" in the Header. This will redirect you to another screen which will,
similar to the Homepage, have a table displaying all the tasks you have completed, the day you started and the day you completed the task.

****************************** To return from any screen to the Homepage, just click the "ToDoList" in the Header ******************************

To Logout, click on "Logout" in the top right corner of the Header.

This is my website, hope you enjoy it!
